## 01. OPENING STATEMENT (Hero)

**Layout**: Full-width, minimal, centered text on soft cream background

**Content**:

```
ABOUT LAB1


We started with a simple observation:

Most people live somewhere between
sick and well.

Not ill enough for intervention.
Not optimized enough to thrive.

We built Lab1 to close that gap.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Large Cormorant headline "ABOUT LAB1" (72px)
- Body text in Darker Grotesque (24px, line-height 1.6)
- Max width 800px, centered
- 300px vertical padding top/bottom
- Color: Olive (#333611) on Cream (#F8F6F0)
- No images. Just words. Just truth.

## 02. THE TRUTH (Why We Exist)

**Layout**: Two-column split (40/60), white background

**Content**:

```
[LEFT COLUMN - Small eyebrow text]
THE PROBLEM

[RIGHT COLUMN - Body text]
Generic supplements are designed for average.

But there is no such thing as average biology.

40% of people carry MTHFR variants that change how they process folate.
Another 40% have FADS variants affecting omega-3 conversion.
VDR polymorphisms alter vitamin D requirements by 2-3x.

Your multivitamin doesn't know this.
Your body does.

For years, we watched this disconnect—in professional sports,
in clinical practice, in our own lives.

Athletes with perfect training programs, hampered by invisible deficiencies.
Patients told "your bloodwork is normal" while struggling with fatigue.
People doing everything right, yet feeling perpetually suboptimal.

The tools existed: DNA testing, comprehensive blood panels,
orthomolecular medicine.

But no one had connected them into a system
that actually worked for how bodies change.

So we built it.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Left column: Uppercase eyebrow (12px, tracked)
- Right column: Generous line height (1.7), 18px
- Section padding: 200px vertical
- Pullquote styling on key stats (40%, 40%, 2-3x) - slightly larger, mono font
- Subtle left border on last paragraph (2px olive)

## 03. OUR APPROACH (How We're Different)

**Layout**: Centered column, max-width 700px, cream background

**Content**:

```
PRECISION, NOT GUESSWORK


Most personalized nutrition asks you questions.
We measure your biology.

Most supplements give you one formula forever.
We rotate yours every three months as your body improves.

Most companies optimize for sales.
We optimize for biomarkers.


The difference is simple:

We don't assume.
We test.

We don't maintain deficiency.
We correct it.

We don't claim transformation.
We prove it with blood tests.


This is medical-grade precision
applied to preventive nutrition.

Not wellness.
Optimization.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Section header "PRECISION, NOT GUESSWORK" in Cormorant (48px)
- Short statements set in columns for rhythm
- "We don't / We do" format creates clean comparison
- Final two words ("Not wellness. / Optimization.") each on own line, larger (24px)
- Ample breathing room between statement blocks (48px)
- Color: Olive on Cream

## 04. EXPERTISE (Who We Are)

**Layout**: Full-width section, charcoal background, light text

**Content**:

```
BUILT BY THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND


Lab1 was founded at the intersection of three worlds:


SPORTS MEDICINE
────────────────

Experience from professional football clubs, Olympic-level athletics,
and elite performance environments.

We've seen what happens when biological optimization
meets human potential.


CLINICAL PRACTICE
────────────────

Decades of combined experience in orthopedics, physiotherapy,
osteopathy, and laboratory medicine.

We understand the gap between "clinically normal"
and "functionally optimal."


ORTHOMOLECULAR SCIENCE
────────────────

Deep expertise in nutrition science, biochemistry, and the emerging
field of nutrigenomics.

We know which forms work, which doses matter,
and why most supplements fail.


Beyond our core team, we draw on a network of specialists across
osteology, biomechanics, movement medicine, and clinical chemistry.

We have access to data that most supplement companies never see:
blood panels from elite athletes, clinical outcomes from thousands
of patients, genetic databases revealing population-wide patterns.

This isn't theory.
It's evidence, tested under the most demanding conditions.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Background: Charcoal (#2A2A2A)
- Text: Cream (#F8F6F0)
- Section headers: White (#FFFFFF), uppercase, 14px, tracked
- Separator lines: Olive (#333611) at 40% opacity
- Three columns on desktop, stack on mobile
- Each expertise area: 64px padding
- Final paragraph: Centered, max-width 600px, italic serif

---

## 05. THE COMMITMENT (What Guides Us)

**Layout**: Narrow centered column, white background

**Content**:

```
WHAT WE BELIEVE


Your biology is not a mystery to be managed.
It's data to be understood.

Fatigue is not a moral failing.
It's measurable. It's correctable.

Optimization is not vanity.
It's your right to feel fully alive.


We will never:

Claim our supplements cure disease.
We're not medicine. We're precision nutrition.

Sell you supplements you don't need.
Our algorithm rotates you off formulas once markers correct.

Hide behind proprietary blends.
Every dose, every form, every rationale—transparent.

Treat you like a transaction.
Your biology changes. Your formula should too.


We will always:

Show you the evidence.
Every recommendation traces back to your DNA or blood data.

Measure what matters.
Biomarkers don't lie. We retest every 90 days.

Respect complexity.
Your body is not simple. Neither is our approach.


This is the standard we hold ourselves to.
Medical-grade thinking.
Applied to how you feel every single day.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Max width: 600px, centered
- Section header: Cormorant 36px
- Opening philosophy: Large (20px), italic
- Lists: Simple, clean, no bullets—just indented text
- "We will never" vs "We will always" creates moral framework
- Generous spacing between list items (32px)
- Final statement: Separated by horizontal rule (olive 20%), larger text

---

## 06. INVITATION (Next Step)

**Layout**: Full-width, centered, minimal

**Content**:

```
We're not here to sell you supplements.

We're here to help you understand
what your body has been trying to tell you.


[Two buttons, side by side]

[Explore Essential Line →]    [Start DNA + Blood Testing →]


Or simply reach out: hello@lab1.com
```

**Design Notes**:
- Background: Cream (#F8F6F0)
- Text: Olive, centered, 24px Cormorant for main statement
- Buttons: Outlined olive, equal weight (not one primary)
- Email link: Small (14px), olive 60%
- Vertical padding: 200px
- No urgency, no pressure—just invitation

## ALTERNATIVE DESIGN ELEMENTS

### Option A: Minimal Team Section (No Names)

If you want to acknowledge the team without full bios:

```
THE TEAM


Lab1 is led by practitioners and founders who have spent
two decades in the spaces where health is measured most precisely:

Professional sports medicine. Elite orthopedics. Clinical laboratories.
Performance nutrition at Olympic level.

We built this because we lived the problem.

Athletes training perfectly but underperforming due to invisible deficiencies.
Patients dismissed with "normal bloodwork" while struggling daily.
Our own bodies telling us something was wrong,
but standard approaches offering no answers.

So we built the system we wished existed.
```

**Design**: 
- Centered text, max-width 700px
- Italicize middle paragraph (the "we lived the problem")
- Clean, no photos, no LinkedIn headshots
- Maintains mystery while establishing credibility

---

### Option B: Data-Driven Credibility

Instead of individual bios, show the depth of expertise through numbers:

```
WHAT WE BRING


15+ years        Combined experience in sports medicine
                 and clinical practice

4 disciplines    Orthopedics, physiotherapy, nutrition science,
                 laboratory medicine

1000s            Patient blood panels analyzed annually

3 countries      Germany, Austria, Switzerland

∞                Hours studying why most supplements fail
```

**Design**:
- Two columns: Number on left (large mono font), description on right
- Minimal, Bloomberg-terminal aesthetic
- Numbers tell the story, not personalities
- Olive on white, very clean

---

### Option C: Network Over Names

Shift focus from individuals to collective expertise:

```
A NETWORK OF SPECIALISTS


Lab1 operates at the intersection of multiple disciplines:

• Sports & Movement Medicine
• Orthopedics & Rehabilitation  
• Nutrition Science & Orthomolecular Medicine
• Clinical Chemistry & Laboratory Diagnostics
• Biomechanics & Human Performance
• Osteology & Metabolic Health

Our core team has direct experience in professional football medicine,
Olympic-level athletics, clinical practice at leading hospitals,
and building digital health companies.

But more importantly, we have access to what matters:

Data from elite athletes operating at biological limits.
Clinical outcomes from patients across thousands of cases.
Laboratory partnerships providing real-time biomarker analysis.

This isn't built on theory.
It's built on evidence from the most demanding testing grounds.
```

**Design**:
- Simple bullet list (actual bullets here, unlike other sections)
- Clean, factual, no hype
- Middle paragraph in regular weight
- Final statement in italic serif, slightly larger

---

## VISUAL DESIGN SUGGESTIONS

### Photography Direction (if using images):

**DO:**
- Lab equipment in natural light (beakers, pipettes, clean surfaces)
- Macro shots of blood samples, cellular structures
- Hands holding test results, DNA reports (anonymous)
- Clinical spaces—empty, clean, quiet
- Abstract: Light through glass, geometric medical tools

**DON'T:**
- Team photos with forced smiles
- Stock images of people in white coats
- Generic "healthy lifestyle" imagery
- Anything that looks like a startup pitch deck

---

### Typography Treatment:

**Headlines**: Cormorant Garamond, 48-72px
- "ABOUT LAB1"
- "PRECISION, NOT GUESSWORK"
- "BUILT BY THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND"

**Body**: Darker Grotesque, 18px, line-height 1.7
- All paragraph text
- Clean, readable, never rushed

**Accent**: IBM Plex Mono, 14-16px
- Statistics (40%, 2-3x, etc.)
- Data points
- Email addresses

**Color**: 
- Primary text: Olive (#333611)
- Backgrounds: Alternate between Cream (#F8F6F0), White (#FFFFFF), Charcoal (#2A2A2A)
- Never more than one background color per section

---

### Spacing Strategy:

**Vertical rhythm**:
- Between major sections: 200-300px
- Between paragraphs: 24-32px
- Between statement blocks: 48-64px
- Line height: 1.6-1.7 for all body text

**Horizontal constraints**:
- Body text: Max 700px width
- Headlines: Max 800px width  
- Full-width sections: Only for dark backgrounds or images
- Always center-aligned for text-only sections

---

### Scroll Experience:

**Section reveals**:
1. Opening statement: Immediate (no animation)
2. "The Truth": Fade up as you scroll
3. "Our Approach": Text blocks reveal one by one (stagger 200ms)
4. "Expertise": Three columns fade in simultaneously
5. "Commitment": Lists reveal on scroll
6. "Invitation": Immediate when reached

**Transitions**:
- No parallax (keep it professional)
- Subtle fade-ups with slight Y-translate (20px)
- 600ms duration, ease-out
- Never jarring, never "wow factor"—just clarity
