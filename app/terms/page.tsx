        <h3>14) Applicable Law</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>14.1</strong> The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies to all legal relationships between the parties, excluding the laws on the international sale of movable goods. For consumers, this choice of law only applies insofar as the protection granted by mandatory provisions of the law of the state in which the consumer has their habitual residence is not withdrawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.2</strong> Furthermore, this choice of law does not apply with regard to the statutory right of withdrawal for consumers who do not belong to a Member State of the European Union at the time of conclusion of the contract and whose sole residence and delivery address at the time of conclusion of the contract are outside the European Union.
        </p>

        <h3>15) Place of Jurisdiction</h3>

If the Customer has their registered office outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Seller's place of business is the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract if the contract or claims arising from the contract can be attributed to the Customer's professional or commercial activity.
        </p>

        <h3>16) Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
